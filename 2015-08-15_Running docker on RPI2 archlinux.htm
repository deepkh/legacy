<p>First of all, I have been try&nbsp;<span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px; white-space: nowrap;">sjoerd's </span><a style="font-size: 18px; white-space: nowrap; color: #660099; cursor: pointer; text-decoration: none;" href="http://sjoerd.luon.net/posts/2015/02/debian-jessie-on-rpi2/">Debian Jessie on Raspberry Pi 2</a>. After install image to rpi2. I'm just apt-get install docker.io. &nbsp;But,&nbsp;</span>unfortunately after install running of that. It's show some text like of "docker only running on 64bit os".</p>
<p>So I have try to find other solution. After I'm search for a while. I find that ArchLinux has been succeeded porting docker 32bit arm to their binary tree. So I'm happyly to install docker on archlinux. Archlinux clear install size 800MB are more fat than Debian Jessie 280MB.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After you install docker succeeded on your RPi2. You should pulling the following docker image on your RPi2. And I have only try "mazzolino/armhf-ubuntu:14.04". The armhf-ubuntu:14.04 seem running well on docker just work like x86_64 ubuntu:14.04. The image size about 280MB. And also I have try to install some build-esstinal. And try to build some code stuff. Seem not bad. But, only concern is that SanDisk Extreme UHS-I 64GB only read 19MB/s and write 18MB/s on my RPi2.&nbsp;</p>
